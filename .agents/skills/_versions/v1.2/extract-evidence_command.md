description: Extract Evidence-Register units for one variable x suitability family from the ingested corpus (T4 method)
---

Run the T4 evidence-extraction step (methodology/T4_generation_method.md section 5): turn ingested
source passages into atomic, provenance-bearing Evidence-Register units -- never PDF -> threshold.

Inputs: a canonical variable, a suitability family, optionally a source set (ask if missing).

Workflow:
1. Canonical variable + aliases + min_meaningful_resolution_m from the Variable Ontology; the family
   target spec; tiers from the benchmarked CSV (Source Register).
2. Ingest + retrieve (deterministic):
     from nbs_ruralscan.ingest import build_index, load_index, save_index
     from nbs_ruralscan.recipe.evidence import package_for_extraction, EvidenceUnit, validate_units, save_units
     idx = load_index(sid) or build_index(pdf, source_id=sid)
     bundle = package_for_extraction(idx, "slope", aliases=["terrain slope","gradient","slope %"])
   Work ONLY from bundle["passages"] (page-stamped). Flag needs_ocr_pages; never guess.
3. Emit one EvidenceUnit per atomic claim.
4. validate_units(units) must return {} before save_units(units, path).
5. Report units, conflicts, anything pending (OCR / figure-only).

Hard rules: quote+page mandatory; null when the source is silent (no inference). **PICOS — the NbS
practice must be evidenced IN the source before you tag it.** Only set `nbs_id` / `suitability_family_id`
if the practice (or its sub-practice) is explicitly present in the passage/source — never infer it from a
demo dataset, worked example, file/paper title, or the sweep's current focus. A generic method demoed on
agroforestry is not agroforestry evidence; a coffee case study does not make a generic variable a coffee
claim. If the practice isn't stated, leave it `cross`/agnostic or skip the row. (Same discipline as
`claim_scope`: species ≠ practice.) Tag use_role
(structural_suitability=T4 | climate_risk=T2 | priority_need=T5 | nbs_effect=T6 | dataset=T1);
evidence_type (only literature_relationship/expert carry shape params); claim_basis; claim_scope
(species/crop claims need taxon and must NOT define a practice row). Set lineage_of when a value is
cited from another source. Capture exclusion/failure thresholds too. No silent unit harmonisation.

**Tool / codebase sources (default behaviour):** a tool is a source — interrogate its **actual code/scripts**, not just the README/landing/abstract. Cache the relevant source file(s); extract hardcoded thresholds / default weights / criteria / exclusion rules as EV with `locator_type=file_line` + `commit_sha` + `locator="path:Lstart-Lend"` (the dashboard deep-links to the lines). `claim_basis=expert_assertion` (tool design choice). Ignore species-specific / off-scope files (`claim_scope`). Skip data-driven engines that hardcode nothing.

**Defect catalogue (from QA review — the recurring off-scope/mis-route mistakes; off_scope is still the #1 defect at ~84%):**
- **Soft enabling-environment ≠ T4 structural suitability (RE-RATIFIED 2026-06-23, reverses 2026-06-22) → `wrong_table`.** `market_access`/`accessibility_travel_time` · `market_value_chain` · `tenure_security` · `extension_governance` · `finance_credit_access` · `labour_availability` · `distance_to_road` are **soft, investment-addressable** factors. Do **NOT** emit them as `use_role=structural_suitability` — they belong to the **M2b Stream-B operational-risk filter + Module-6 next-steps**, not the suitability surface. Answer to "T4 or T3?" = **soft enabling-env → T3/M2b/next-steps; T4 only for HARD legal masks** (protected areas, water bodies, urban — `is_scenario_candidate=false`). (~13 of these were flagged in 2026-06-23 QA.) Extract them with **`use_role=operational_risk`** (the M2b enum member, 2026-06-23) — they synthesise into a flagged `operational_constraint` recipe section, kept OUT of the T4 suitability surface. HARD legal masks stay `structural_suitability`.
- **PICOS — wrong practice ≠ agroforestry → `wrong_practice`.** The NbS practice must be EVIDENCED in the source. **Reforestation, afforestation, pure forestry/plantation, "climate-smart agriculture"/CSA umbrella, generic forest restoration are NOT agroforestry.** Do not borrow the agroforestry tag from the sweep's focus, a demo dataset, or a file title — if the source's intervention isn't agroforestry/silvo (alley-crop, silvopasture, windbreak, parkland, FMNR, shaded perennial…), leave `nbs_id` blank / don't extract. (2026-06-23: fesenmyer25 reforestation, brandt2015 CSA were mis-mapped.)
- **Results/output description ≠ a rule.** "regions were classified as suitable", "the map shows priority zones", "potential areas for agroforestry" describe a *produced output*, not a per-pixel suitability criterion. Off-scope.
- **Trend/distribution description ≠ suitability.** "tree cover increased over the past decades", "biomass distribution", global/temporal trends. Off-scope (and tree-cover ≠ agroforestry).
- **Speculation/assumption ≠ evidence → `speculative_evidence`.** "we assume", "may still deter", "could potentially", "is a reflection", "hand-wavy assumed causation" — hedged/speculative claims that were not measured or used in the analysis. Skip.
- **CAPTURE THE RELATIONSHIP — don't drop the curve → `relationship_missed`.** When a source gives a suitability *relationship* (a membership curve, a monotonic decline with distance, "very high = fine texture, high = fine-to-coarse", a min/opt/max band), that directionality IS the evidence — encode it in `relationship`. Capturing the variable name but losing the curve is a BIG miss (2026-06-23: singh26 monotonic distance/precip/MAT/slope/soil-texture/soil-drainage relationships were all dropped). Read the membership/classification logic, not just the variable label.
- **Tool weights need scale + standardisation context → `uninterpretable_weight`.** A bare "5" is uninterpretable ("5 out of what?"). When extracting a tool weight/score, the quote (or `attribution`) must carry the scale (e.g. "0–10", "region-specific HUC default") and what is being weighted, so it can be compared across sources. land_cover with no class list (which classes in/out) is likewise uninterpretable.
- **Variable-presence vote ≠ usable threshold.** A paper confirming a variable matters (a vote for `n_sources`) is not the same as a usable classification threshold — capture which one it is; don't manufacture a threshold from a mention.
- **Figure-only / table-screengrab evidence → `insufficient_context`.** If the value lives in a figure, or a table cell has no caption / surrounding context (or the screengrab fails to render), flag `needs_ocr`/figure-read and ask the human; don't guess. A cell that renders as "CUADRO 4" with no caption cannot be reviewed.
- **Constrained-AOI framing → `constrained_aoi`.** A source that scopes the NbS onto a *subset* of land understates where it's actually feasible + misrepresents the opportunity-space extent. Classic: **land-capability / land-use-capacity classifications** (USDA-LCC-style, e.g. INAB Guatemala) that assign agroforestry as a **residual / "marginal land"** bucket (what's left after prime agriculture + protection forest). AF is also feasible on good land → those thresholds say "where it was *allocated*", not "where it *can go*". A framing bias of an on-topic source (≠ `off_scope`, ≠ `wrong_practice`). **Down-weight; never use to set the AOI/extent or a global threshold** — at most a region-flagged qualitative vote (`claim_basis=expert_assertion`). Watch any allocation/capability/zoning scheme.
`check_scope.py` flags `results_description` / `trend_description` / `speculation` / study-site / carbon-biomass / problem-intro; **`check_picos.py`** flags wrong-practice; both feed **`quarantine.py`** which auto-soft-deletes off-scope + wrong-practice on build (reversible). Getting these right at extraction time keeps them out of the quarantine in the first place.
