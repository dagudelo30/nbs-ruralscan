# NbS Rural Scan

Methodology and demonstrator for spatial prioritisation of Nature-based
Solutions in rural, agricultural, and forestry landscapes. Funded by the World
Bank (D591). Implemented by Alliance Bioversity International & CIAT.

> ⚠ **Status:** v0 work-in-progress. Mock data only. Not yet a production
> decision tool.

## 👋 Team kickoff — start here

Welcome Benson, Namita, Brayden (and everyone else who lands here). This repo is
the shared home for our methodology and workflow going forward. **Please spend
~15 minutes reading this section before picking up any work.**

> **New to the repo / setting up Claude Code on your own machine?** Start with
> **[`ONBOARDING.md`](./ONBOARDING.md)** — a step-by-step handover (install, one-time
> setup incl. Windows, current project state, and first prompts by lane).

### What's here

The scaffolding covers the methodology (modules, schema, recipes), the team's
working conventions, and a populated project board with the first 15 issues.
It's a _spine_ you hang your work off — not a replacement for what's already
been done.

### Three things to look at, with your feedback in mind

1. **[Pipeline architecture (v0.5)](https://ciat.github.io/nbs_ruralscan/pipeline.html)**
   — one-page map of the 7 modules + the M2b disaster-risk addendum and the
   T0–T7 schema. The _framework primitives_ layer at the top (canonical
   membership functions, hybrid weighting, MCDA engine, recipe template) is
   reusable and read by every module; some run back-end and aren't surfaced in
   the TTL view.
2. **Module specs — M1 and M2**
   - **[M1 Suitability](./methodology/modules/M1_suitability.md)** — the I/O
     contract and 8 sub-steps for the suitability → opportunity-space stage,
     implemented in Python under `src/nbs_ruralscan/`. Function signatures in
     §13.
   - **[M2 Rural Climate Risk](./methodology/modules/M2_climate_risk.md)** —
     **Brayden**, pre-scaffolded for you. Mode A vs Mode B, double-count guard
     with M3/M4, function signatures for `src/nbs_ruralscan/runtime/climate_risk.py`
     (v0.3.0 schema annotations in §14). Six open methodology questions at the
     bottom that need your view.
3. **Repo conventions + workflow** — [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md),
   [`PLAYBOOK.md`](./PLAYBOOK.md), [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
   **Namita** — keen on your take here since you'll coordinate recipe
   authoring + Variable Cards.

### Ownership (current — June 2026)

> Shifted since the kickoff snapshot. See the
> [Delivery board](https://github.com/orgs/CIAT/projects/2) for live,
> issue-level state.

- **Pete** — framework integrity & scope-control · M0 Setup · **M1 Suitability ·
  M3 Opportunity Space · M4 Priority Hotspots** · M6 Implementation Hand-off
  (lead) · recipe/spec/module authoring
- **Brayden** — M2 Rural Climate Risk · M2b Project Disaster-Risk · **dataset
  download layer (T1 → Python) and analytical-context construction (T7);
  server-side preferred (GEE / STAC / large services)**
- **Namita** — **Task H focus
  ([expert-opinion elicitation & integration protocol](file:///Users/pstewarda/Documents/rprojects/nbs_ruralscan/methodology/expert_opinion_protocol.md))**
  · expert-opinion elicitation · coordination · **QA/QC across all modules**
  (dataset fitness sign-off, output validation, resolution audit — from Benson)
- **Benson** — **left the project (Aug 2026)**; framework primitives stay
  attributed to him (inherited work). QA/QC passed to Namita.
- **MFL team** (Sarah · Chris · Evert · Hannes) — M6 hand-off content,
  ecosystem-services & domain input

Runtime is **Python via Claude Code** (`src/nbs_ruralscan/`), driven by Brayden
/ Anastasia / Pete. The standalone **GEE App is dropped** — we pull GEE data and
run its server-side processing through **xee** (Earth Engine ↔ xarray), compute
with xarray / rioxarray, and build/stress-test the method through the wireframe.

**Implementation pathway is bifurcated.** Minimum committed deliverable is a
Colab notebook worked example per pilot (the WB contract obligation — notebooks,
not a polished web app). In parallel, the **Claude-Code-built front/back end**
is being explored against the same schema (wireframe = front-end demonstrator;
backend reads `schema/registers/` + T0–T7). Both consumers read the same
registers — schema stability matters.

### Feedback forum — 1:1 catch-ups

Given staggered availability (Namita out next week; Brayden on leave Monday),
the walkthrough happens as three separate 1:1s rather than a group session:

- **Benson — Monday** (calendar invite already sent). 60 min, focused on the
  framework primitives layer, M1, and the architecture overall.
- **Brayden — when back**. 30–45 min, focused on M2 and the six open methodology
  questions.
- **Namita — when back**. 45–60 min, focused on recipes, M3/M5, Variable Cards,
  and the workflow side.

In each: bring questions, pushback, "this is wrong because…" — all welcome.

### Framings worth flagging

- This is **scaffolding**, not a fait accompli.
- The framework primitives draw on prior CIAT MCDA work and are treated as
  canonical.
- Module specs are I/O contracts you can adjust, not briefs being handed to you.
- The wireframe is being sent for visual polish separately — feedback on flow
  and content is welcome.

## What this is

A scoping and decision-support framework that helps World Bank Task Team Leaders
(TTLs) identify where different Nature-based Solutions could be invested in, how
extensive the opportunity is, and which TTL priorities (poverty, biodiversity,
climate risk, gender equity) intersect that opportunity space. Outputs are
reproducible Jupyter/Colab notebooks plus an interactive demonstrator UI.

## Live demonstrator

**https://ciat.github.io/nbs_ruralscan/**

Includes:

- **TTL Tool Wireframe** — interactive mockup of the decision-support tool
- **Pipeline Architecture (v0.5)** — one-page methodology architecture diagram
- **Data Schema (v0.3.0)** — the T0–T7 ERD, field-level spec, evidence/config
  registers, and draft-0 example tables (structure frozen + machine-validated)
- **[Evidence & Literature Dashboard](https://ciat.github.io/nbs_ruralscan/dashboard.html)**
  — browse the SRC/EV evidence registers, the literature interrogator, the
  ontology/network views, the stocktake benchmark, and the search & discovery
  logs. Includes a **QA/QC review** workflow (public view is read-only; running
  the local `review_server.py` enables reviewer edits — see
  [`docs/REVIEWER_GUIDE.md`](./docs/REVIEWER_GUIDE.md)).

Demonstrators use mock Sierra Leone / agroforestry data.

## Project board

Active work is tracked at the
**[NbS Rural Scan — Delivery board](https://github.com/orgs/CIAT/projects/2)**.
Five columns (Backlog · This week · In progress · Review · Done); new issues
auto-add to Backlog. See
[`.github/PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md`](./.github/PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md) for the
setup runbook.

## Working in this repo — quick start (≈10 minutes)

The development environment is **VS Code + Claude Code in the integrated
terminal**. Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` automatically on every session so
you're never starting cold.

### One-time setup

> **On Windows?** Follow **[`ONBOARDING.md` §4](./ONBOARDING.md#4-one-time-setup-on-your-machine-windows)**
> instead — it has the PowerShell installers and the Git-Bash / OneDrive gotchas. The macOS
> path is below.

```bash
# 1. Tools
brew install gh                                   # GitHub CLI (for issue/PR commands)
curl -fsSL https://claude.com/install.sh | bash   # Claude Code installer
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh   # uv — Python runner (tests, generators, review server)
# (Or follow https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup for your platform)
gh auth login                                     # authenticate GitHub CLI

# 2. Clone and open
git clone https://github.com/CIAT/nbs_ruralscan.git
cd nbs_ruralscan
bash scripts/setup-repo.sh                        # one-time: JSON merge driver + autocrlf=false
code .                                            # opens in VS Code
```

In VS Code, the Source Control panel (left sidebar, branch icon — or `⌃ ⇧ G`)
shows git status. The integrated terminal (`⌃ \``) is where you'll run Claude
Code.

### Your typical loop

In VS Code's integrated terminal, from the repo root:

```bash
git pull                          # sync with main
git checkout -b feat/your-task    # branch
claude                            # start Claude Code in this repo
```

Claude Code now reads `AGENTS.md` and is grounded in project context. Tell it
what you want — for example:

> _"I'm picking up issue #6 (Agroforestry recipe). Read
> `methodology/recipes/water_harvesting.md` as the template, then scaffold
> `methodology/recipes/agroforestry.md` with the same eight-section structure.
> Stop after the master variable table so I can populate the rows."_

Iterate, test, then commit and push via VS Code's Source Control panel or by
asking Claude Code to do it for you. Raise the PR via the GitHub UI or
`gh pr create`; use the PR template.

If you're brand new, **read AGENTS.md and PLAYBOOK.md before your first issue.**
Together they're about 15 minutes. They'll save you days of misunderstanding the
architecture.
