# Discovery log — Agroforestry × T4 (suitability) — retrospective

**Date(s):** April 2026 – June 2026 (Stocktake) · June 2026 (paper-first F1 sweeps).
**Author(s):** Lolita Müller (Stocktake screening + benchmark scoring) · Pete Steward (paper-first sweeps + this log) · Claude Code (operator).
**Seed-set rule:** T4 method §3 bounded, authority-weighted seed-set (v0.2.6 / v0.2.7 SOP). Cap ~10-20 sources per NbS × table.
**Screening funnel:** five-step (frame · source-type triage · relevance · six-axis credibility · saturation stop). C/I/D rubric used in the Stocktake; six-axis rubric (v0.2.7) reconciles to the same `benchmark_tier`.

> **Retrospective.** This log captures what was done **before** the v0.2.7 PRISMA-lite SOP existed. Numbers are reconstructed from the Stocktake benchmarked CSV + the paper-first sweeps committed to this repo. Forward logs (#27) will follow the SOP from the start.

## Sources & databases queried

### Stocktake Review (Apr-Jun 2026, pre-repo)

- **OpenAlex API** (peer-reviewed lit) — see `2_Technical_&_Data/Stocktake Review/Open Alex search/OpenAlex_run.R` + `search_string.xlsx`. Queries built on NbS-practice keywords × spatial-suitability / MCDA / land-evaluation terms.
- **GPT grey-lit pull** — targeted grey-literature scan (project reports, FAO/CGIAR institutional reports) flagged on the same search strings.
- **Manual Zotero screening** — full-text screening folder: `…/Stocktake Review/Manual Screening/Zotero_Full_Text_Screening/Agroforestry/`. 23 PDFs retained (1:1 with the benchmarked CSV's AF practice rows).
- **Benchmark scoring** — C / I / D rubric: Content (variable inventory + thresholds + provenance), Impact (citation count + journal impact factor + citations/year), Data quality (method validation + spatial scale + transparency). Final tier: `Final_Benchmark ∈ {High, Medium, Low}` in `NbS_peer_reviewed_benchmarked.csv` (220 rows total).

### Paper-first sweeps (June 2026, this repo)

- **Frame:** F1 Planted silvoarable agroforestry suitability variables (T4).
- **Corpus:** the 23 AF PDFs from the Stocktake (already discovered + tiered).
- **Method:** paper-first SOP per `T4_generation_method.md` §3 (v0.2.6+) — one PDF visit per paper, all variables + relationships in one pass, harmonise to VONT, tier-weight, synthesise.
- **Tools:** local ingest cache (`src/nbs_ruralscan/ingest/`, vectorless retrieval over page-tagged + table-extracted PDF index, OCR fallback). Cache gitignored (PDFs copyrighted).

### Phase 2: Unified Synthesis & WOCAT Ingestion (June 2026, Issue #24)

- **WOCAT SLM Database (Liniger et al., 2011)** — targeted extraction of biophysical thresholds and baseline establishment costs for the F1 agroforestry family.
- **Scientific Synthesis Papers**:
  - **CGIAR (Simelton et al., 2021)** — agricultural NBS functions mapping to priority themes.
  - **GCA (2022)** — State and Trends agroforestry enabler findings (tenure, finance).
  - **WRI (Collins et al., 2025)** — Sub-Saharan Africa climate-resilience cost-effectiveness.

## Exclusions

### Stocktake Review (Apr-Jun 2026)

- **Out-of-NbS-scope** — papers tagged to other clusters (forest conservation, wetlands, water-harvesting, etc.) — not in the AF subset.
- **Out-of-spatial-suitability scope** — agronomy / species-physiology papers without a spatial / MCDA / land-evaluation component.
- **Pure species-suitability papers** ("suitability of *Lansium domesticum*") — screening rule kept the corpus at agroforestry-practice-level, not single-tree.
- **Pre-2000 cutoff** — applied at OpenAlex query stage.
- **Non-English** — current screening pipeline doesn't translate; flagged as a known bias (mostly affects Brazilian + Francophone-Africa lit which is partially represented via English-language outputs).

### Paper-first F1 sweep (June 2026)

- **Family-mismatched papers excluded at sweep time:**
  - `kiziridis_2026` (Med, Mediterranean): silvopastoral → F3 family. Excluded from F1 sweeps; will be picked up when F3 silvopastoral comes into scope.
  - `baldwin_2022` (Med, USA): flood NbS (FloodWise), not silvoarable agroforestry. Excluded from F1; relevant to water-harvesting / flood-mitigation recipes.
  - `singh_2024` (Med, India): remote-sensing/nanotech survey, no spatial-suitability classes. Variable-first EVs only (precip selection signal).
  - `ellis_2000` (Low, USA): FADSS species-DB framing; species-suitability angle conflicts with practice-level T4. Variable-first selection signals only.
- **Species/crop-specific claims** (`claim_scope = species_specific` / `crop_specific`) **dropped at synthesis** (filtered by `synthesise_t4_row`): Mushtaq mulberry (Morus alba), Haris sengon (Falcataria moluccana), Wotlolan multi-crop Pacific. Their **slope** evidence retained (technology-driven); their **climate** evidence routed to species suitability.

## Notes

### Judgement calls

- **LMIC preference (six-axis rubric)** applied as a tie-break only — global syntheses (e.g. Zomer 2014) admitted on authority grounds even though they're "global" rather than LMIC-specific.
- **Seminality flag** not yet populated (`SRC.is_seminal`) — would mark Zomer 2014, Nair 1993 as foundational. Backfill task.
- **Independence / COI discount** not triggered for any AF source — none of the 18 sources are advocacy-funded promotional grey lit.
- **Tier tension** documented on slope (`methodology/examples/t4_slice_agroforestry_F1_slope.md`): High-tier sources (Mendonça, Brandt) gave relief rankings, not hard cuts; Low/Med-tier (Nath, Mushtaq, Haris, Seja) gave the crisp numeric thresholds. Synthesised with **High for shape, Low/Med for magnitude**, with the divergence recorded rather than averaged away.

### Saturation stop

- The 23-paper AF corpus was kept whole (not capped at 10-20) because the corpus *is* the v0.2.7 seed-set for AF/T4; no Phase 2 re-discovery has been run yet (issues #20-#26 cover that).
- Saturation reached on the **5 fully-extracted variables** (slope, precip, MAT, pH, SOC) — additional Med/Low-tier papers added context but no new thresholds. Six-axis rubric flagged that the four High-tier papers (Brandt, Castle, Mendonça×2, Palma) **systematically provide selection signals, not shape**; this is the corpus's structural bias (climate-smart targeting + Brazilian relief ranking), not a screening miss.

### Known biases

- **Optimistic-corpus bias** documented in `T4_generation_method.md` §6.1 (where NbS *works* is over-represented; failures are under-published). Conservative synthesis defaults applied.
- **Geographic skew toward South-Asian AHP studies** at Med/Low tier (Indian + Ethiopian context dominates the threshold-bearing papers). High-tier papers cover Brazil, Europe, US Midwest, Kenya.
- **Stocktake `Input_Variables` column is sparse** (3-9 papers per variable) — agroforestry-specific input-variables xlsx sheet is **empty**; the corpus-text-derived candidate-variable register (`schema/registers/CV_candidate_variables_agroforestry_F1.md`) was built post-hoc in this repo to bridge the gap.

### Pending for Phase 2 re-discovery (issues open)

- **#20** T6 bounded-corpus (effectiveness + conditionality).
- **#21** T3 bounded-corpus (hazard mitigation + vulnerability).
- **#22** CSA adoption & barriers ingest.
- **#23** MEL/MELIA seed-set.
- **#24** WOCAT seed-set (SLM technologies DB).
- **#25** Evidence Gap Maps (3ie/Campbell/CEE).
- **#26** WB project evidence (PADs/ICRs/IEG) + TORs tools.

When these land, this log gets a §"Phase 2 amendments" with the additional sources + counts.

## Relationship re-extraction — singh_2026 (2026-06-23)

QA (2026-06-23) flagged 7 `singh_2026` (Odisha AF suitability, Singh et al. 2026, Front. Remote Sens.) rows as `relationship_missed` — the variable was captured but the membership curve was not. Re-extracted **Table 1** ("Agroforestry classes/fuzzy scale for continuous data", p4) via the deterministic pipeline (`build_index` → page-stamped passage → emit → `validate_units` → verbatim guardrail):

| variable | use_role | relationship (verbatim, Table 1) |
|---|---|---|
| slope | structural_suitability | sigmoidal decreasing (negative) |
| mean_annual_temperature | structural_suitability | monotonically increasing linear (positive) |
| annual_precipitation (rainfall) | structural_suitability | sigmoidal increasing (positive) |
| soil_texture_hsg | structural_suitability | Fine (VH) / Fine-to-course (H) / Course (Mod) |
| soil_drainage | structural_suitability | Very well (VH) / Well (H) / Mod well (Mod) |
| distance_to_road | **operational_risk** | monotonically decreasing linear (negative) |
| accessibility_travel_time (dist. from settlement) | **operational_risk** | monotonically decreasing linear (negative) |

All 7 verified verbatim against p4; 0 number-provenance flags (shape/class membership, no smuggled numbers). Distance vars routed to `operational_risk` per the 2026-06-23 hard/soft split (M2b lever, off the T4 suitability surface).
