# Discovery log — Agroforestry × F2 regeneration_farmland (FMNR/ANR/RNA) — T4·T3·T6

**Date:** 2026-07-17.
**Author(s):** Pete Steward (orchestrated) · Claude Code (operator).
**Sub-practice:** `agroforestry__regeneration_farmland` (F2) — Farmer-Managed Natural Regeneration (FMNR), incl. Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) and French *régénération naturelle assistée* (RNA). Agroforestry via protecting + managing natural tree/shrub regeneration on farmland/parkland (Sahel re-greening, parkland restoration) — **not** tree planting.
**Run id:** `fmnr_2026-07` · **Ruleset:** v1.2.
**Issue:** #115 (per-sub-practice agroforestry evidence gaps). Fills the F2 gaps T3=0 and T6=0, deepens thin T4 (was 3 rows).
**Seed-set rule:** T4 method §3 bounded, authority-weighted seed-set. Cap ~15–20 sources across the three tables.
**Screening funnel:** five-step (frame · source-type triage · relevance · six-axis credibility → `benchmark_tier` · saturation stop). Grey positive-bias discount applied.

## Sources & databases queried

Six discovery lenses (parallel), all title-anchored / authority-weighted, executed 2026-07-17:

1. **OpenAlex REST API — T4 suitability.** `title.search` (display_name) on FMNR/ANR/RNA synonyms (EN/FR) × biophysical & land-condition terms (rainfall, aridity, soil, degradation, parkland, slope), sorted by citations.
2. **OpenAlex — T3 climate-hazard response.** FMNR/ANR/RNA × drought / climate-resilience / regreening-drought-Sahel.
3. **OpenAlex — T6 outcomes + cost.** FMNR/ANR/RNA × yield / adoption / income / tree-density / carbon / biodiversity / cost.
4. **Grey literature (authority orgs).** WebSearch of CRS, WRI, World Agroforestry/ICRAF, FAO, Regreening Africa, ELD/GIZ, World Vision, IUCN for downloadable technical guidance / MEL / economic reports.
5. **WOCAT SLM Technologies database** — FMNR / ANR technology entries (LMIC-grounded establishment conditions + benefits).
6. **Seed backward/forward citation** — canonical FMNR literature (Reij & Garrity 2016, Weston 2015, Binam 2015 & 2017, Chomba 2020, Sendzimir 2011, Haglund 2011, Garrity 2010), confirmed via OpenAlex.

**Multilingual:** title-search included EN (“farmer managed natural regeneration”, “assisted natural regeneration”) + FR (“régénération naturelle assistée”, RNA). Two FR Sahel sources included (ijbcs Mali adoption; ESJ RNA×millet).

## PRISMA-lite counts (sweep-level)

| stage | n |
|---|---|
| Retrieved (raw across 6 lenses) | 58 |
| Removed at dedup (cross-lens duplicates) | 22 |
| Unique screened | 36 |
| **Included** | **19** |
| Excluded (venue-authority / saturation / COI / acquire-risk / scope-drift) | 17 |

Per-table included (membership — a source counts under each table it serves): **T4 = 11 · T3 = 9 · T6 = 11.**
By discovery process: updated_lit = 14 · grey = 5.

`crs_fmnr_niger_2025` (already registered) did not re-surface. All 19 carried `fmnr_explicit=true` (no PICOS failures); two borderline species/ecology-framed RNA items were dropped at relevance/saturation.

## Included (19) → acquisition outcome

**Cached & indexed (13):** chomba_2020, lohbeck_2020, researchsquare_fmnr_2025 (preprint, Low tier), ijbcs_rna_mali_2020, weston_2015, binam_2017, glce_fmnr_mali_2023, sendzimir_2011, wri_regreening_2015 (grey), fao_anr_2019 (grey), eld_fmnr_2020 (grey), wocat_507_2019 (grey), wocat_1358_2017 (grey).

**Not cached (6) — follow-up pass:**
- Cloudflare-403 (retry): `ijecc_anr_niger_2023`, `esj_rna_millet_2020`.
- Paywalled / no free full-text → **library acquisition** (SharePoint): `kessler_1994` (Elsevier), `ldd_anr_arid_2024` (Wiley), `haglund_2011` (Elsevier-only), `binam_2015` (repo landing, no PDF).

**Acquisition notes:**
- OA PDFs resolved via Unpaywall best-OA-location; several OA hosts (Frontiers, AJOL, unil repository) block the generic tool UA → cached with a browser UA. Follow-up: add a browser-UA fallback to `ingest/acquire.py` (recurring — also hit in the 2026-06 sweep).
- **WOCAT handling rule (new):** the technology web page is a JS SPA shell (near-empty HTML snapshot); acquire the **per-technology PDF export** `wocat.net/en/database/technologies/<id>/pdf/` instead.

## Excluded (17) — reasons

Low-tier / predatory venues (Int J Environmental Sciences, Int J Advanced Research, JSIC); saturation-redundant with stronger Sahel anchors; World Vision advocacy manual trio (COI / positive-bias flood-risk on T6); no-DOI grad thesis (acquire-risk); scope-drift (WOCAT area-closure/exclosure → pastoral rangeland; Garrity 2010 evergreen-agriculture/Faidherbia framing); Reij & Garrity 2016 (canonical but closed narrative synthesis, its drivers/scaling signal already carried by Chomba 2020 + Sendzimir 2011 + Lohbeck 2020).

## Provenance

- Search protocol: SRCH register rows `agroforestry__{T4,T3,T6}__{updated_lit,grey}__agroforestry__regeneration_farmland__2026-07-17`.
- Ledger: `searched=done` + `screened=done` stamped per (table × category × family) for `fmnr_2026-07`.
- Extraction (deterministic pipeline → staging → central gates) tracked separately; ledger `extracted`/`verified`/`reviewed` advance only as those steps complete.

## Backfill: stock + tool processes (run `fmnr_stock_tool_backfill_2026-08`, 2026-08-05)

The July FMNR sweep logged only `updated_lit` + `grey`. Audit (2026-08-05) found `stock`
and `tool` were never logged for F2 — closed here so all 4 processes are on record.

| process | table | retrieved | screened | included | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stock | T4 | 168 | 12 | 2 | Kessler1994 parkland woody-species dynamics (OA); Sendzimir2011 already held via updated_lit. Temperate-forestry "natural regeneration" (Fagus/spruce/pine) excluded — wrong practice. |
| stock | T3 | 168 | 12 | 1 | Sendzimir2011 regreening/resilience Sahel (OA, 268c) — drought-resilience anchor (likely already registered). |
| stock | T6 | 168 | 12 | 3 | ANR carbon cost-effective 2015 (closed → queued); Drivers of FMNR Sahel 2020 (OA); local-institutions agroforestry adoption 2017 (OA). |
| tool | T4/T3/T6 | 19 | 5 | 0 | **No dedicated FMNR/ANR practice-suitability or MCDA tool exists.** 19 "FMNR" GitHub repos = unrelated acronym/hobby; Regreening Africa = data portal, not a rule-encoding tool. Genuine tool gap (as for F3 silvopastoral). |

**stock net (verbatim):** `title.search:(FMNR OR "farmer managed natural regeneration" OR "assisted natural regeneration" OR "natural regeneration" OR regreening OR "regeneration naturelle assistee") AND (parkland OR Sahel OR density OR drought OR yield OR adoption OR carbon OR suitability OR agroforestry); sort=cited_by_count:desc`
