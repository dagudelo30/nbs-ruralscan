# Discovery log — Forest Restoration · passive_regeneration · T6

- Run `forest_restoration_discovery_2026-08` · date 2026-08-05 · by Pete/Claude · ruleset v1.4.1
- **Scope:** discovery + screening only. No extraction.
- **grey + tool = complete.** **stock + updated_lit = IN PROGRESS** — OpenAlex hit its daily budget (HTTP 429, resets midnight UTC); candidates below are provisional (WebSearch/canon fallback), to be finalised with real OpenAlex nets on rerun.

## Gaps / next iteration

OpenAlex daily budget hit $0 after a SINGLE query, so only the stock process has a real API retrieved count (238); updated_lit true counts are outstanding - RERUN the two verbatim boolean+date OpenAlex queries after midnight-UTC reset to complete that row. Content gaps for F1 passive-regeneration T6: (1) cost_per_ha_restored figures that ISOLATE pure passive NR (most grey/lit lump passive NR with ANR - the ANR sibling scope keeps leaking into cost anchors); (2) survival/success rates conditioned on regeneration-potential drivers (remnant-cover %, seed-source proximity, prior land-use intensity) rather than pooled; (3) African/Asian LMIC outcome+cost evidence (surfaced set is Latin-America-heavy - Rozendaal/Chazdon/Brazil); (4) MEL/adoption evidence for passive-NR schemes (dis-adoption when land re-cleared) - none surfaced. Tool gap: no T6-outcome/cost tool with extractable hardcoded parameters - WRI ROAM/Restoration Diagnostic are handbooks (no code); seed_dispersal_mapper is T4 potential only. A carbon-accumulation-rate dataset/tool (Cook-Patton-style regrowth curves) was NOT verbatim-surfaced this pass and should be sought for cost_per_tCO2e. PICOS watch: exclude single-species SDM and enrichment-planting papers seen in the stock query tail.
