# Rural NbS Scan — Cross-cutting Methodological Framework

*Living document · v0.1 draft · May 2026*

The framework defines the cross-cutting analytical strategy used across every Nature-based Solution in the Rural NbS Scan. It is **NbS-agnostic**. Per-NbS specifics (variables, thresholds, weights, datasets) live in the recipes (`methodology/recipes/`) and the schema (`schema/`).

## Architectural layering

The methodology is implemented in three explicit layers — kept separate so each can evolve independently:

| Layer | Role | Files |
|---|---|---|
| **Framework** | Cross-cutting methodology · MCDA engine · standardisation library · schema. NbS-agnostic. | `methodology/framework.md` · `schema/` |
| **Recipe** | Per-NbS configuration. Variables, response functions, weights, subpractice families. | `methodology/recipes/<nbs_id>.md` |
| **Runtime** | Python method package (xarray · rioxarray · xee) · Colab pilot notebooks. | `src/nbs_ruralscan/` · `pipeline/` |

## Seven analytical modules (+ M2b project-risk addendum)

| ID | Module | Question answered | Schema tables |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Setup & Scope | AOI · NbS · resolution · scenario · ingestion check | T0, T1, T7 |
| **M1** | Suitability → Opportunity Space | Where could this NbS biophysically work? | T1, T4, T7 |
| **M2** | Rural Climate Risk | Where are rural **livelihoods** exposed to climate hazards (baseline + future)? | T1, T2 |
| **M2b** | Project Disaster Risk Screen *(addendum)* | Where could disasters damage/destroy the **investment**? (WB disaster-screening lens) | T2, T3 |
| **M3** | Opp Space Characterisation | What's in the opportunity space (poverty, biodiversity, GESI, production, pop)? | T1, T5 |
| **M4** | Priority Hotspots (MCDA) | Where within the opp space do TTL priorities concentrate? | T5 |
| **M5** | NbS Scorecard & Response | What can this NbS plausibly address (Likert) + economic profile? | T3, T6 |
| **M6** | Implementation Hand-off | What comes next after scoping (feasibility tools, contextualisation)? | T0, T6 |

See the architecture diagram: [`docs/pipeline.html`](../docs/pipeline.html).

## Inherited framework primitives

The components below originated in Benson's water-harvesting recipe and v2 methodology plan. They are treated as canonical framework components used across all recipes.

| Primitive | Origin | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| 5 fuzzy membership functions (sigmoid, linear, Gaussian, bell, inverted sigmoid) | v2 plan §4 / `recipes/water_harvesting.md` §5 | M1, M3, M4 |
| Hybrid AHP + CRITIC + Entropy weighting (α-reconciled) | v2 plan §7 / `recipes/water_harvesting.md` §6 | M1, M3, M4 |
| Reference MCDA implementation | `reference/R/spatMCDA.R` | M1, M3, M4 |
| Recipe template column structure | `recipes/water_harvesting.md` §2.2 | All recipes |
| Subpractice family pattern | `recipes/water_harvesting.md` §1 | All recipes with within-NbS variation |
| Sensitivity perturbation (±10% weight shuffle) | spatMCDA.R / WH recipe §9 | M1, M3, M4 |

## Climate risk formulation

The framework follows the IPCC AR6 risk decomposition: **Risk = Hazard × Exposure × Vulnerability**, where **Vulnerability = f(Sensitivity, Adaptive Capacity)**.

Two operational modes, selectable by the user (Schema T2 flag `use_in_simplified_mode` vs `use_in_advanced_mode`):

- **Mode A — Hazard × Exposure** (pilot default). Simpler, fewer assumptions; avoids double-counting vulnerability variables that also appear in M3/M4 TTL priorities.
- **Mode B — Full IPCC AR6** with vulnerability composite. Use when context warrants it.

The mode toggle is user-facing. Outputs metadata records the mode used so runs are not inadvertently compared across modes.

## Variable selection (two stages)

Every recipe applies variable reduction before variables enter the MCDA. Two stages:

1. **Thematic grouping** — expert, per-NbS, done once when the recipe is built. Six standard themes: topographic · hydrological · soil · climatic · LULC · socio-econ + hazard.
2. **Correlation-based reduction** — empirical, per study area. After fuzzy standardisation, compute pairwise correlation; cluster variables with |r| > 0.7; pick one representative per cluster (highest variance or expert-flagged primary).

The cluster membership is preserved and surfaced in the UI (Variable Config tab in the wireframe). One representative per cluster enters the MCDA — but users can promote any clustered variable to a primary in technical mode.

## Dataset sourcing (three-tier preference)

For each variable, the recipe's `T1` Data Registry entry uses the first option that satisfies fitness-for-purpose:

1. **GEE catalog asset** if a credible one exists
2. **Community-hosted GEE asset** (e.g. `projects/sat-io/open-datasets/`)
3. **Upload** if the best-fit dataset isn't already hosted

Fitness for purpose precedes platform. We do not substitute the best dataset for an inferior one just because the better one isn't already in GEE.

## Spatial standardisation

All datasets resampled to a standard global coordinate reference frame and pre-processed at multiple tiers (10km · 5km · 1km · 500m · 100m) so analytical resolution is a configurable parameter. The pipeline generates a **resolution audit table** showing which datasets are at native resolution vs upsampled / downsampled. Upsampling beyond one tier triggers a visible warning — synthetic fine-scale variability is misleading.

## Uncertainty & sensitivity

Run the analysis with perturbed weights (±10% by default) and produce sensitivity maps. Where feasible, parameter ranges in the recipe (`uncertainty_pct` field in T4) propagate to confidence bands on the final surface.

## What this framework does not do

- Not ecosystem service modelling (no InVEST, ARIES, or similar)
- Not site-level feasibility design
- Not full cost-benefit analysis (only indicative economic archetypes via T6)
- Not optimisation
- Not detailed climate impact modelling beyond hazard exposure

These belong downstream of scoping — pointed to in M6 Implementation Hand-off.

## Authoring conventions

- The pipeline reads analytical rules from the schema. **Never hardcode rules in code.**
- Each new NbS is added by writing a new recipe (`methodology/recipes/<nbs_id>.md`) + schema rows in `schema/recipes/<nbs_id>/`. No code changes required.
- New analytical methods (beyond the inherited primitives above) require a methodology RFC issue and team sign-off.
