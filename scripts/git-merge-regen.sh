# Custom git merge driver for GENERATED JSON (dashboard_data.json, progress.json, the
# register *.json). These are committed (GitHub Pages serves them statically) but are a
# deterministic function of the CSV source of truth — so any two branches that both touch
# the registers collide on the regenerated JSON with a meaningless line-level conflict.
#
# Instead of a 3-way text merge, this driver ignores BOTH sides and rebuilds the file from
# the (already-merged) CSVs via generate.py, then drops the fresh content into git's result
# slot. Registered in .gitattributes as `merge=regen`; activated per-clone by scripts/setup-repo.sh.
#
# git calls:  git-merge-regen.sh %O %A %B %P
#   %O ($1) = common-ancestor blob   %A ($2) = OUR/result file (driver must leave result here)
#   %B ($3) = THEIR blob             %P ($4) = pathname of the file in the repo
