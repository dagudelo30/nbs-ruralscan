# Ship your QA review decisions to a clean PR — one command.
#
# Run AFTER you've reviewed flags in the dashboard QA/QC tab (your ok/drop decisions are
# saved locally in pipeline/review/decisions.json). This replaces the fiddly manual git
# dance that kept reverting other people's work and burying tiny review edits in 50k-line
# generated-JSON conflicts.
#
# What it does:
#   1. branches fresh off the LATEST main (so nothing is stale / nothing gets reverted),
#   2. replays your decisions onto the current registers (surgical — only the rows you
#      decided change) and regenerates the JSON,
#   3. commits ONLY the registers + review_log + generated JSON (never dashboard.html etc.),
#   4. pushes and opens a PR.
#
# Your decisions.json is gitignored, so it survives the branch switch untouched.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/submit-review.sh <your-handle> ["PR title"] [--auto]
#   e.g.  bash scripts/submit-review.sh Namita-J "qaqc: agroforestry T3 batch"
#         bash scripts/submit-review.sh Namita-J "qaqc: T3 batch" --auto   # also merges it
# Run it ONCE per review session (it ships every agreed decision in one PR) — not per flag,
# or you'll mint a PR per click. --auto squash-merges immediately (no approval needed).
set -e
# --auto (anywhere in the args): squash-merge the PR immediately after opening it, so a
# review batch needs zero manual clicks. Safe because main is unprotected + the content is
# low-risk review metadata applied via the canonical path. Drop it to leave the PR for review.
