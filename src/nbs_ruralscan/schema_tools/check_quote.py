"""Deterministic quote-context check (the too-narrow-quote defect).

A verbatim quote can still be useless if it's an isolated table cell — "30-40 pt",
"873.60", "Located in protected area" — with no surrounding sentence or table
caption/header to say what the number means, whether it's a suitability claim, or
whether the scope is species vs practice. 2026-06-18 measurement: ~11% of active units
were <=10 words, and the short tail is where table-garble / smuggled-unit / off-scope /
species-envelope defects hide.

Rule (extract-evidence skill #9): a quote must carry the full threshold SENTENCE plus the
table caption/header that defines the variable & unit — never a bare cell.

This flags active, unreviewed units whose quote is shorter than `MIN_WORDS`. Advisory
(some legitimately-short claims exist), so it flags for review, never fails the build.
