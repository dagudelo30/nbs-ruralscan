"""QA/QC performance stats — measure how well the AI verify-flag system actually works.

The relationship-verify pass FLAGS some EV units (verdict=mismatch/unsupported) and silently
PASSES the rest. Humans then review both (logged in pipeline/metrics/review_log.csv). Crossing
the AI verdict with the human decision gives a confusion matrix — the only honest way to know
whether the AI is catching real errors or crying wolf (and whether it's letting errors through):

                    human: GOOD (ok)            human: BAD (drop / missed_error)
  AI flagged    FP  (false_flag)            TP  (real error caught)
  AI passed     TN  (confirmed_pass)        FN  (error the AI missed — found in spot-check)

precision = TP/(TP+FP)  — of what the AI flagged, how much was real.
recall_est = TP/(TP+FN) — estimate ONLY (FN comes from sampled passes, not a full census).

Stats reflect APPLIED/logged decisions (the durable record), not in-session unapplied ones.
Shipped into dashboard_data.json by generate.py; rendered in the QA/QC tab's Stats view.
