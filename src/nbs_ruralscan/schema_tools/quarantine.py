"""Auto-quarantine off-scope / wrong-practice evidence (QA guard "B", 2026-06-23).

2026-06-23 human QA dropped 61/102 reviewed units (60%) — dominated by off-scope
extraction (study-site / problem-statement / biomass / mapped-result *descriptions*) and
wrong-practice mis-mapping (reforestation, CSA umbrella tagged as agroforestry). The
deterministic checks (`check_scope`, `check_picos`) already flag these; this module ACTS on
them — soft-deleting (`review_state=dropped`) so they stop polluting the live register and
the AI-flagged worklist, while staying fully reversible + auditable (the locked soft-delete
model). Chosen over a build-FAIL because the signals are regex proxies: the reviewer keeps
the final call (re-open restores the row); the guard just stops junk reaching them by default.

SAFETY — never re-quarantines a row a human has touched:
  * `reviewer_ok=true`           — already signed off
  * `review_state` already set   — already dropped/quarantined
  * evidence_id in `review_log`  — a human applied a decision (incl. a re-open)
  * evidence_id in `decisions.json` — a human has an in-progress decision

Each quarantined row is stamped `[AUTO-QUARANTINE <kind>:<signal>]` in `attribution`
(idempotent) so the dashboard's dropped view + git history show exactly why.

Run on the WRITE path of `generate.py` only (never on `--check`, which must not mutate).
CLI: `python -m nbs_ruralscan.schema_tools.quarantine schema [--apply]` (default = dry-run).
